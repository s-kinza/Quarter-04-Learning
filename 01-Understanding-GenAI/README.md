# What is Generative Ai ?

Generative AI is an advanced subset of artificial intelligence that goes beyond simply analyzing or predicting â€” it creates. By learning from massive datasets, it can generate new content such as images, text, music, and even code. This technology is widely used in areas like content creation, design, healthcare, and education, offering new ways to automate work, personalize user experiences, and boost innovation. Unlike traditional AI systems that focus on decision-making or classification, generative AI is designed to produce original, human-like outputs.
